I have decided to study the association of the present day's media influence with the populations opinions. I used key words such as political affiliation, media, public opinion, and influence. I have noticed in my research that media may, in fact, alter a person's beliefs (even without their knowledge). I plan to study this further and understand to what degree the media can affect one person's opinions and ideals.

While reading the above articles, I have noticed a few themes:
1. Media has the ability to influence a group of people without the people even being aware of it.
2. People get most of their news from partisan news outlets and therefore become more likely to be influenced by this media.
