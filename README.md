I have decided to study the association of the present day's media influence with the populations opinions. I used key words such as political affiliation, media, public opinion, and influence. I have noticed in my research that media may, in fact, alter a person's beliefs (even without their knowledge). I plan to study this further and understand to what degree the media can affect one person's opinions and ideals.

# I'm going to use Outlook On Life as my chosen data set.
