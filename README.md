I love my dog, Indy. I still don't know what I want to do for a career. I enjoy learning about the human mind. I have never met anyone famous. I used to live in Beijing, China in ninth grade.

I have decided to study the association of the present day's media influence with the populations opinions. I used key words such as political affiliation, media, public opinion, and influence. I have noticed in my research that media may, in fact, alter a person's beliefs (even without their knowledge). I plan to study this further and understand to what degree the media can affect one person's opinions and ideals.

# I'm going to use Outlook On Life for my chosen data set.
